    If you want to change a nixos generation entry name, so just modificate
    `/boot/loader/loader.conf`. It doesn't change name of this generation
    completely deep, but it's a fast way

        If you yet want to do it all the way deep, so change:
        > `/nix/var/nix/profiles/system-profiles/` files
        > `/boot/loader/loader.conf` file
        > `/boot/loader/entries/` files
